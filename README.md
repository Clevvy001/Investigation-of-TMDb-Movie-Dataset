# Investigation-of-TMDb-Movie-Dataset
This project analyzes the TMDb Movie Dataset to investigate the relationships between main features of each movie.
In this project, I will be investigating a data set that contains information about 10000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). In the course of this analysis, more emphasis will be laid on investigating the relationship between popularity of the movie genre and the revenue generated from it. It will also investigate which genres are most popular from year to year, and also the impact of the movie casts used on the revenue generated. The data set contains relevant columns such as Genres, Casts, Revenue, Popularity and Vote counts.
# Conclusions
In the course of this analysis, many investigations and explorations of the dataset were made. In the data cleaning section of the analysis, irrelevant columns were dropped, null entries were found and filled, duplicate entries were found and dropped, and the index of the dataframe was changed. In the data exploration section of the analysis, few questions listed at the onset were used to investigate the dataset.

## What is the impact of the vote counts on the popularity of the movie?
The impact of the vote counts of the movie and its popularity was investigated using a scattered plot. The analysis on the scattered plot revealed that there exists no relationship between the vote counts and the popularity. No linear regression or correlation between the two data entries were obtained.

## What is the relationship between the popularity of the movie and the revenue generated from it?
The relationship between revenue generated from a movie and its popularity was investigated using a scattered plot. The analysis on the scattered plot revealed that there exists no relationship between the revenue generated from the movie and the popularity. No linear regression or correlation between the two data entries were obtained.

## Is there a correlation between budget and revenue?
The scattered plot shows that there isnâ€™t a correlation between the budget and the revenue. It was observed from the analysis that each movie produced made a certain amount of profit based on the analysis but no linear relationship between the amount budgeted and the revenue generated was found.

## Which movie genres are most popular from year to year?
The Action|Adventure|Science Fiction|Thriller is the most popular movie genre.

# Limitations
One of the limitations observed from this dataset during the course of the data analysis is the inability to get a correlation between two variables in the dataset either negatively or positively. This limitation makes it challenging to come to a reasonable conclusion on the properties that affect the popularity of the movies.

Another limitation observed during this analysis arose from the limited knwoledge of the data analyst on vast and effective data exploration tools. This limitation can be addressed by investing time and efforts into learning the vital toolset relevant to data analysis.
